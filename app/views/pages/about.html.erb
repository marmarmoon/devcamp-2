<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr>
<p>Hi!
My name is Martina Martinez yes, before you ask, that is my birth given name. I am just starting to code so everything is new and exciting to me.</p>
<p> I am a seventeen year old wannabe Software Developer, I guess you could say that in a couple months or so I can call myself a real developer but for now I'm a noobie at this.</p>
<P>I like food, video games and learning new things aside from coding all day.</P>
<p>I can't wait for you to learn more about me and the things I can do throughout this portfolio. </p>
